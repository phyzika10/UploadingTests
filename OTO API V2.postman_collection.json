					"description": "Before you can create orders, generate shipments, or print Air Waybills (AWBs) in your OTO account, there are a few important setup steps you must complete. Follow this guide to ensure your account is fully activated and ready to operate smoothly.\n\n### 1\\. Verify Your Account\n\nAfter creating your OTO account:\n\n- Navigate to **Settings → My Profile**.\n    \n- Verify your **phone number** and **email address** to complete your profile verification.\n    \n\n---\n\n### 2\\. Activate Your Refresh Token\n\n- Go to **Settings → API Integrations**.\n    \n- Click the **Connect** button to activate your **Refresh Token**.\n    \n\n---\n\n### 3\\. Generate an Access Token\n\n- Use your refresh token to obtain an access token by sending a request to the **Refresh Token** endpoint:\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/refreshToken\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### 4\\. (Optional) Configure Delivery Company Integrations\n\nIf you have existing contracts with delivery companies and prefer using them instead of OTO’s rates:\n\n#### Step 1: Retrieve Available Delivery Companies\n\n- Get the list of integrated delivery companies:\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcList\n\n ```\n\n- Identify the **company code** you want to configure.\n    \n\n#### Step 2: Get the Configuration Template\n\n- Retrieve the required fields and credentials template for the selected delivery company:\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcConfig\n\n ```\n\n#### Step 3: Activate Delivery Company Integration\n\n- Submit the completed configuration to activate the delivery company:\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcActivation\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### 5\\. (Optional) Create Pickup Locations\n\nIf you have fixed pickup locations:\n\n- Pre-save them in your account using the **Create Pickup Location** endpoint:\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/createPickupLocation\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### 6\\. Charge Your Wallet\n\nBefore creating shipments, ensure your account has enough balance. You have two options:\n\n- **Per shipment**: Calculate the required balance for each shipment using either:\n    \n    - `POST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/checkOTODeliveryFee` (for OTO rates)\n        \n    - `POST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/checkDeliveryFee` (for your own contract rates)\n        \n- **Bulk top-up**: Add balance manually in advance.\n    \n\nTo charge your wallet, use the **Buy Credit** endpoint:\n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/buyCredit\n\n ```\n\n✅ Once all these steps are completed, you are ready to start creating shipments and using OTO’s full range of services!"

					"description": "### **Step 1: Create an Order**\n\nTo create a shipment, you must create an order in your OTO account. You can do this using the **`createOrder`** endpoint:\n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/createOrder\n\n ```\n\n#### **Prerequisites: Provide Sender Information**\n\nWhen creating an order, you need to provide sender information. There are two methods, depending on your business needs:\n\n**Fixed Pickup Locations**:\n\n- Use createPickupLocation endpoint to create a pickup location.\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/createPickupLocation\n\n ```\n\n- After creating a pickup location, you’ll receive a **pickupLocationCode**, which you can use in the **`createOrder`** request, eliminating the need to enter sender address details every time.\n    \n\n**Flexible Pickup Locations**:\n\n- If your addresses change frequently, skip the fixed pickup location creation and provide the sender details directly in the **`senderInformation`** object within the **`createOrder`** request.\n    \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Create a Shipment**\n\nOnce your order is created, you can proceed to create a shipment. You can do this in two ways:\n\n#### **Create Shipment via** **`createShipment`** **endpoint:**\n\nUse the **`createShipment`** endpoint to create a shipment by providing the **`orderId`** and **`deliveryOptionId`**:\n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/createShipment\n\n ```\n\nThere are two ways to determine the **`deliveryOptionId`**:\n\n**Delivery Options with OTO Rates**:\n\n- No contracted delivery companies or activation is required. OTO offers a range of delivery company options, which are available for use. You can view these options and their associated fees by using the Check OTO Delivery Fee endpoint and get the deliveryOptionId.\n    \n\n``` bash\n  https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/checkOTODeliveryFee\n\n ```\n\n**Delivery Options with Your Own Rates**:\n\n- If you have agreements with specific delivery companies, each one will have a linked **`deliveryOptionId`**. You can retrieve these IDs using the following endpoints:\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/checkOTODeliveryFee \n\n ```\n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/checkDeliveryFee\n\n ```\n\n#### **Create Shipment via** **`createOrder`** **endpoint:**\n\nAlternatively, you can create the shipment directly during the **`createOrder`** step by adding a **`createShipment: true`** parameter in the request body:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"createShipment\": true\n}\n\n ```\n\nThis will automatically create the shipment without needing a separate **`createShipment`** call.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Print AWB (Shipping Label)**\n\n#### **Print AWB via API**\n\nTo print the Air Waybill (AWB) for your shipment, use the **`print`** endpoint:\n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/print/:orderId\n\n ```\n\nReplace **`:orderId`** with the actual order ID to retrieve the AWB URL for printing.\n\n#### **Print AWB via Webhook**\n\nTo receive AWB via webhooks, use the **`webhook`** endpoint:\n\n```\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/webhook\n\n ```\n\n- Set the **webhookType** to **`orderStatus`**.\n    \n- Get the AWB with `printAWBURL` parameter.\n    \n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Track Your Shipment**\n\nYou can track shipments in two ways: using API endpoints or via webhooks.\n\n#### **Track Shipments via API**\n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/orderStatus\n\n ```\n\nRetrieves details such as:\n\n- Current status (e.g., pickedUp, outForDelivery, delivered).\n    \n- Shipment details, including carrier, tracking number, and estimated delivery time.\n    \n- AWB URL.\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/orderHistory\n\n ```\n\n- Retrieves status changes (e.g., pickedUp, arrivedTerminal, delivered).\n    \n- Provides timestamps for each status update and actions taken (e.g., cancellations or modifications).\n    \n\n#### **Track Shipments via Webhook**\n\nTo receive real-time updates via webhooks, use the **`webhook`** endpoint:\n\n```\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/webhook\n\n ```\n\n- Set the **webhookType** to **`orderStatus`**.\n    \n- Once configured, OTO will automatically send status updates to the provided webhook URL, notifying you of changes without the need to make additional requests.\n    \n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/62004f73-3581-43dc-b5b0-7a8d8e694605/Q1JFQVRFIEEgU0hJUE1FTlQgR1VJREVfZHJhd2lvICgxKS5wbmc=\">"

					"description": "# Marketplace Integration Guide\n\nThis document outlines the roadmap for integrating marketplace companies with the OTO system. It provides a structured, step-by-step process to seamlessly onboard vendors/sellers, ensuring each is correctly registered, connected, and operational within the OTO ecosystem.\n\n### Vendor/Seller Management Models\n\nOTO offers two distinct approaches to managing vendors, allowing marketplaces to choose the model that best suits their operations:\n\n## 1\\. Manage Vendors/Sellers as Sub-Accounts\n\nIn this model, each vendor is registered as a **separate sub-account**, managed independently under a **main marketplace account**.\n\n### Steps to Set Up:\n\n**a. Obtain a Marketplace Token:**\n\nRequest a marketplace token from your OTO account manager or support team.\n\n**b. Get Access Token:**\n\nUse your marketplace token to request a fresh access token:  \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/refreshToken\n\n ```\n\n**c. Register a Vendor/Seller:**\n\nAfter obtaining the access token, register vendors/sellers individually:  \n`POST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/register`\n\n⚡ _Important:_ Capture the **refresh token** returned for each seller. Each seller receives a unique refresh token, which must be used for all transactions related to that specific seller account.\n\n**d. Update Vendor/Seller Information:**\n\nTo update seller details, send a request to:  \n\n``` bash\nPOST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/clientInfo\n\n ```\n\n**e. Charge Vendor/Seller Accounts:**\n\nEach vendor manages their own wallet.\n\nTo add credit to a vendor account:  \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/buyCredit\n\n ```\n\n**f. Check Vendor/Seller Balance:**\n\nRetrieve account balance information via:  \n\n``` bash\nGET https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/clientInfo\n\n ```\n\n**g. Add Delivery Company Settings for Each Vendor**\n\nIf vendors have their own delivery company contracts, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Retrieve Delivery Companies List:**  \n    `GET https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcList`\n    \n    (Find the delivery company’s unique code.)\n    \n2. **Get Delivery Company Configuration Template:**  \n    `POST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcConfig`\n    \n    (Use the company code to retrieve the required configuration fields.)\n    \n3. **Activate Delivery Company:**  \n    `POST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcActivation`\n    \n    (Use the configuration object to activate the vendor’s delivery company.)\n    \n\n## 2\\. Manage Vendors/Sellers Under One Main Account\n\nIn this model, vendors/sellers are managed centrally under a **single marketplace account**. Sellers are recorded as **Brands** and **Pickup Locations**.\n\n### Steps to Set Up:\n\n**a. Get a refresh token:**\n\nFrom your OTO account, click on the Settings menu and then the API integration menu. Click on the Connect button to create an API token. This token is your refresh token.\n\n**b. Get Access Token:**\n\nUse your refresh token to request a fresh access token:  \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/refreshToken\n\n ```\n\n**c. Create Brands:**\n\nRegister each vendor as a brand:  \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/createBrand\n\n ```\n\n- **Create Pickup Locations (Optional):**  \n    Save vendor addresses as pickup locations, linked to their brands, create a pickup location using the createPickupLocation endpoint and enter the brandName information you created in the brandName parameter.\n    \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/createPickupLocation\n\n ```\n\nExample request:\n\n``` bash\n{\n  \"brandName\": \"Vendor A\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n- **Specify Sender Address at Order Creation:**\n    \n    Alternatively, you can skip creating pickup locations and directly provide sender information in the order creation request via the `senderInformation` object at the `createOrder` endpoint.\n    \n    Fill the `storeName` field with the corresponding brand name.\n    \n\n**d. Charge Main Account:**\n\nManage all transactions from a single wallet by charging the main account balance:  \n\n``` bash\nhttps://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/buyCredit\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n**e. Add Delivery Company Settings for Vendors Under Main Account**\n\nIf vendors have their own delivery company contracts:\n\n1. **Retrieve Delivery Companies List:**  \n    `GET https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcList`\n    \n    (Find the delivery company’s unique code.)\n    \n2. **Get Delivery Company Configuration Template:**  \n    `POST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcConfig`\n    \n    (Use the company code to retrieve the required configuration fields.)\n    \n3. **Activate Delivery Company:**  \n    `POST https://api.tryoto.com/rest/v2/dcActivation`\n    \n    (Use the configuration object to activate the vendor’s delivery company.)\n    \n\n🛎 **Important:**\n\nWhen activating a delivery company for a specific vendor, assign the related **brand** by using the `brandId` parameter in the DC Activation request.\n\nThis ensures you can differentiate delivery company contracts between vendors.\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/123f5e80-da2b-4a94-90af-18d3b2d9287b/bWFya2V0cGxhY2UgaW50ZWdyYXRpb24uZHJhd2lvICgxKS5wbmc=\">"

						"description": "**Available Packages:** All Packages\n\nThis API endpoint allows you create shipment for orders, while creating shipments need a valid delivery option id. You can get valid delivery options in two ways:\n\n- **Delivery Options with OTO rates**:  \n    No contracted delivery companies or activation is required. OTO offers a range of delivery company options, which are available for use. You can view these options and their associated fees by using the `Check OTO Delivery Fee` endpoint.\n    \n- **Delivery Options with your own rates:**  \n    In this case, you already have agreements with one or more delivery companies. Each delivery company you connect is linked to a specific delivery option ID. You can retrieve these IDs by using the `Get Delivery Options` or `checkDeliveryFee` endpoints.\n    \n\n**Note:** If deliveryOptionId is not sent on the request, the assignment is made to the delivery company that complies with your feasibility rule. If you do not have a feasibility rule setting, the order will be automatically assigned to the first delivery company added.\n\n**Request Parameters:**\n\n| Name | Required | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| orderId | yes | string | Order number for which you want to create a shipment |\n| deliveryOptionId | no | int | Activated delivery company option id |\n| pickingType | no | enum | Possible values:  <br>PICKUP_BY_DC: Shipping company offers free pickup from origin. BRANCH_DROP_OFF: Package must be delivered to a branch of the shipping company. |\n| whoPays | no | enum | If implemented, annotates who wil pay for the shipment. Possible values: marketplacePaysDeliveryFee, sellerPaysDeliveryFee |"
